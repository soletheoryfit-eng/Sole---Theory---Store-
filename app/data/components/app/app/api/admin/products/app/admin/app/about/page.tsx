        I’ve always been obsessed with sneakers — the design, the comfort, the confidence they bring.
        That passion became <strong>SoleTheory</strong> — a store for people who see sneakers as more than shoes.
        Every pair we sell is handpicked with care and built for comfort and style.
        We’re based in Romania, and we ship globally from verified suppliers.
